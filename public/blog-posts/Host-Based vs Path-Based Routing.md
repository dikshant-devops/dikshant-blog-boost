# Host-Based vs Path-Based Routing in Load Balancers  

When designing scalable applications, routing strategies play a crucial role in ensuring traffic is directed to the right service. Modern load balancers provide advanced routing mechanisms such as **host-based routing** and **path-based routing**, enabling more flexibility and control.  

In this blog, weâ€™ll explore both concepts, their differences, and common use cases.

## ðŸ”¹ What is Host-Based Routing?  

**Host-based routing** (also known as **domain-based routing**) directs traffic based on the **hostname (domain)** specified in the requestâ€™s **HTTP Host header**.  

For example:  

- `api.example.com` â†’ Routes to the API service  
- `blog.example.com` â†’ Routes to the blog service  
- `shop.example.com` â†’ Routes to the e-commerce service  

### âœ… Benefits:  
- Helps run multiple applications under different domains/subdomains.  
- Simplifies multi-service architecture under a single load balancer.  
- Commonly used in **microservices** and **multi-tenant applications**.

## ðŸ”¹ Wh
at is Path-Based Routing?  

**Path-based routing** (also known as **URL-based routing**) directs traffic based on the **URL path** in the request.  

For example:  

- `example.com/api/*` â†’ Routes to the API backend  
- `example.com/blog/*` â†’ Routes to the blog backend  
- `example.com/shop/*` â†’ Routes to the e-commerce backend  

### âœ… Benefits:  
- Allows multiple services under the **same domain**.  
- Provides finer-grained routing compared to host-based.  
- Useful for **monolith-to-microservices migration**, where paths can be redirected to different backends without changing the domain.

## ðŸ”¹ Host-Based vs Path-Based Routing  

| Feature                  | Host-Based Routing                  | Path-Based Routing                   |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Routing Decision**     | Based on **hostname/domain**        | Based on **URL path**                 |
| **Example**              | `api.example.com` â†’ API service     | `example.com/api/` â†’ API service      |
| **Domain Usage**         | Requires multiple subdomains        | Uses a single domain with paths       |
| **Best For**             | Multi-domain, multi-service setups  | Single domain with multiple services  |
| **Flexibility**          | Moderate                            | High (can split requests by path)     |

## ðŸ”¹ Common Use Cases  

### Host-Based Routing  
- SaaS platforms hosting multiple customers with separate domains.  
- Applications where services need to be clearly separated by domain, e.g., `admin.example.com`, `user.example.com`.  
- Microservices where each service has its own subdomain.  

### Path-Based Routing  
- Applications with multiple services under one domain.  
- Progressive migration from monolith to microservices.  
- APIs grouped under a single domain with distinct paths.

## ðŸ”¹ Example in AWS Application Load Balancer  

In AWS ALB:  
- **Host-based rule**:
   IF host is api.example.com â†’ Forward to Target Group: API
- **Path-based rule**:
  IF path is /blog/* â†’ Forward to Target Group: Blog
  This flexibility helps deploy complex architectures without requiring separate load balancers for each service.

## ðŸ”¹ Conclusion  

Both **host-based** and **path-based routing** are powerful mechanisms in load balancers.  
- Use **host-based routing** when you want to separate services by **domain**.  
- Use **path-based routing** when you want to serve multiple services under a **single domain**.  

In real-world systems, itâ€™s common to use a **combination of both** for maximum flexibility and scalability.
