# Essential Git Commands Every Developer Should Know

Git is the backbone of modern software development, enabling teams to collaborate effectively and maintain code history. Whether you're a beginner or looking to refresh your knowledge, this comprehensive guide covers the essential Git commands every developer should master.

## What is Git?

Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in source code during software development. It allows multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously while maintaining a complete history of all changes.

## Setting Up Git

Before diving into commands, ensure Git is properly configured:

```bash
# Set your identity
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"

# Check your configuration
git config --list
```

## Essential Git Commands

### 1. Repository Initialization and Cloning

**Initialize a new repository:**
```bash
git init
```
Creates a new Git repository in the current directory.

**Clone an existing repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
git clone git@github.com:username/repository.git  # SSH
```

### 2. Basic Workflow Commands

**Check repository status:**
```bash
git status
```
Shows the working tree status, including tracked/untracked files and staging area.

**Add files to staging area:**
```bash
git add filename.txt        # Add specific file
git add .                   # Add all files
git add *.js               # Add all JS files
git add -A                 # Add all changes including deletions
```

**Commit changes:**
```bash
git commit -m "Add login functionality"
git commit -am "Quick commit"  # Add and commit tracked files
```

**View commit history:**
```bash
git log
git log --oneline          # Compact view
git log --graph           # Visual branch representation
git log -p                # Show file changes
```

### 3. Branch Management

**List branches:**
```bash
git branch                 # Local branches
git branch -r             # Remote branches
git branch -a             # All branches
```

**Create and switch branches:**
```bash
git branch feature-login   # Create branch
git checkout feature-login # Switch to branch
git checkout -b feature-new # Create and switch in one command
git switch feature-login   # Modern way to switch branches
```

**Merge branches:**
```bash
git checkout main
git merge feature-login
```

**Delete branches:**
```bash
git branch -d feature-login     # Delete merged branch
git branch -D feature-login     # Force delete unmerged branch
```

### 4. Remote Repository Operations

**Add remote repository:**
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repo.git
git remote -v              # View remotes
```

**Push changes:**
```bash
git push origin main       # Push to main branch
git push -u origin feature # Push and set upstream
git push --all            # Push all branches
```

**Pull changes:**
```bash
git pull origin main       # Fetch and merge
git fetch origin          # Fetch without merging
```

### 5. Undoing Changes

**Unstage files:**
```bash
git reset filename.txt     # Unstage specific file
git reset                 # Unstage all files
```

**Discard local changes:**
```bash
git checkout -- filename.txt  # Discard changes to file
git restore filename.txt      # Modern way to restore file
git clean -fd                 # Remove untracked files and directories
```

**Revert commits:**
```bash
git revert HEAD           # Revert last commit
git revert commit-hash    # Revert specific commit
git reset --soft HEAD~1   # Undo last commit, keep changes staged
git reset --hard HEAD~1   # Undo last commit, discard changes
```

### 6. Stashing Changes

**Save work temporarily:**
```bash
git stash                 # Stash current changes
git stash save "WIP: login feature"  # Stash with message
git stash list           # List all stashes
git stash pop            # Apply and remove latest stash
git stash apply          # Apply stash without removing
git stash drop           # Delete a stash
```

### 7. Viewing Differences

**Compare changes:**
```bash
git diff                 # Working directory vs staging
git diff --staged        # Staging vs last commit
git diff HEAD           # Working directory vs last commit
git diff branch1 branch2 # Compare branches
```

### 8. Advanced Commands

**Interactive rebase:**
```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~3     # Rebase last 3 commits
```

**Cherry-pick commits:**
```bash
git cherry-pick commit-hash
```

**Tag releases:**
```bash
git tag v1.0.0           # Create lightweight tag
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0"  # Annotated tag
git push origin --tags   # Push tags to remote
```

## Git Workflow Best Practices

### 1. **Use Meaningful Commit Messages**
```bash
# Good
git commit -m "Add user authentication with JWT tokens"

# Bad
git commit -m "Fix stuff"
```

### 2. **Follow a Branching Strategy**
- **Feature branches**: `feature/user-auth`
- **Bug fixes**: `bugfix/login-error`
- **Hotfixes**: `hotfix/security-patch`

### 3. **Regular Commits**
Make small, frequent commits rather than large ones:
```bash
git add auth.js
git commit -m "Add password validation function"

git add login.html
git commit -m "Update login form UI"
```

### 4. **Keep Your Repository Clean**
```bash
# Remove merged branches
git branch --merged | grep -v "\*\|main\|develop" | xargs -n 1 git branch -d

# Update branch list
git remote prune origin
```

## Common Git Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Fixing a Mistake in the Last Commit
```bash
# Add forgotten files
git add forgotten-file.js
git commit --amend --no-edit

# Change commit message
git commit --amend -m "New commit message"
```

### Scenario 2: Moving Changes to a New Branch
```bash
# You're on main but should be on a feature branch
git checkout -b feature-branch
git checkout main
git reset --hard HEAD~1  # Remove commits from main
```

### Scenario 3: Collaborating on a Feature Branch
```bash
# Start working on existing feature
git checkout feature-branch
git pull origin feature-branch

# Push your changes
git push origin feature-branch
```

## Visual Git Tools

While command-line is powerful, visual tools can help understand Git better:

- **GitKraken**: Intuitive GUI client
- **SourceTree**: Free Git client by Atlassian
- **VS Code**: Built-in Git integration
- **GitHub Desktop**: Simple Git interface

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Merge Conflicts
```bash
# When conflicts occur during merge
git status                    # See conflicted files
# Edit files to resolve conflicts
git add conflicted-file.js   # Mark as resolved
git commit                   # Complete the merge
```

### Accidentally Deleted Files
```bash
git checkout HEAD -- deleted-file.js  # Restore from last commit
```

### Wrong Branch
```bash
git stash                    # Save current work
git checkout correct-branch  # Switch to right branch
git stash pop               # Apply your work
```
